`avalanche-types` crate implements Avalanche primitive types in Rust: transaction types/serialization, keys, addresses, peer-to-peer messages, etc.. The basic types available in this crate will be foundational for many upcoming Rust projects for Avalanche (e.g., Rust SDK for custom VM, distributed load tester, [`avalanche-ops`](https://github.com/ava-labs/avalanche-ops)).
